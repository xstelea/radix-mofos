Mofo #001: Neon Shard Reaper

Meet Neon Shard Reaper, the OG of the Radix Mofos crew—#001 in a 10,000-strong legion of blockchain renegades. This elusive figure stalks the neon-drenched underbelly of the Radix network, harvesting lost shards of XRD with a glowing scythe etched with Cerberus runes. Adorned in a fractured trench coat pulsing with teal circuitry, the Reaper’s fractal mask hides a mysterious past tied to the dawn of DeFi. Rare and ruthless, this Mofo’s got a 1-of-1 trait: a shimmering Shard Crown that marks them as the first to rise from the Radix Engine. Own this legend and stake your claim in the revolution—fast, fierce, and forever decentralized.
